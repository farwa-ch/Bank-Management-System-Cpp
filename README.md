# Bank-Management-System-Cpp
A beginner-level, console-based Bank Management System in C++ focused on practicing OOP fundamentals and academic problem modeling.
# Bank Management System in C++

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository contains a **simple, console-based Bank Management System** implemented in **C++** as part of my academic learning.  
The project focuses on applying **core programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** to model a real-world problem in a structured and understandable way.

The system is intentionally kept **simple and beginner-friendly**, making it suitable for **3rd semester Computer Science students** and learners who are building a strong foundation in C++.

## 🎯 Motivation
Understanding how real-world systems can be represented using programming concepts is a fundamental skill in Computer Science.  
This project was developed to practice **problem decomposition**, **class design**, and **logical flow control**, which are essential skills for **research-oriented and academic work**.

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Objectives
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++
- Design a real-world problem using classes and objects
- Implement a menu-driven console application
- Manage multiple entities using arrays
- Strengthen logical thinking and debugging skills

---

## ✨ Features
- Create a bank account
- Deposit money into an account
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Check account balance
- Display account information
- Simple user interaction through a menu-driven interface

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries:** iostream (only)
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
- **Application Type:** Console-based

---

## 🧩 System Design
Each bank account is represented as an object of a class.  
Multiple accounts are stored using an **array of objects**, allowing the system to handle several users during program execution.

All operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry are performed using **member functions**, ensuring a clear separation between data and behavior.
